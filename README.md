# EmailSender

This Python script utilizes the smtplib library to send an email through a Gmail account. It creates an EmailMessage object and sets the sender, recipient, subject, and HTML content of the email. The HTML content is read from an 'index.html' file using the Template class from the string module. The email is then sent using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) with the provided Gmail credentials (email address and password). The script demonstrates a basic email sending functionality, with the HTML content dynamically substituting a placeholder ('name') in the template. Note that using hardcoded email credentials in scripts may pose security risks, and it's advisable to employ more secure methods, such as environment variables, for storing sensitive information.
